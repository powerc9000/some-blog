Some Blog
=========

####A Node.js, Mongodb and Angular.js blog platform.

###Installing

Some Blog needs Node.js, NPM and Mongodb 

Some of the Node modules may need to be recompiled for your system so running `npm rebuild` would be smart.

I will probably remove the npm_modules folder soon so you can just run `npm install` might be smarter.

###Running

Simply do `node app.js` and navigate to `localhost:3000`
